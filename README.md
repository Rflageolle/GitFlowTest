 ## Git-Flow 
    
    - From the man himself https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
    - By utilizing git-flow in your projects you are not losing any function of the regular git commands
    - **Download Instructions** --  https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation
    
  **Set Up**
  ```shell
    $ cd #/.../smoke
    $ git-flow init
  ```
   - this will step you through the process of initializing prefrences text in brackets [] are defaults, leave the defaults   alone
 
 ### Main Branches

   + master
   + develop
    
 ### Support Branches
 
   + Feature Branches 
        + Typically branch from develop 
        + Always merge back into develop
        + name it feature-(your-unique-feature-name)
        
        - These branches exist as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually make it to the dev branch
      
        - **Creating Feature Branch**
          Creates a new feature branch from develop and switches to it.
           ```shell
            $ cd #/.../smoke
            $ git branch    # check you are in develop branch, if not checkout develop branch
            $ git-flow feature start feature-<feature's-name>  
           ```
        - **Finishing a Feature**  (when you want to merge it back into develop)
          ```shell
            $ cd #/.../smoke
            $ git-flow feature finish <finished-feature>
          ```
      
          - Merges feature into develop
          - Removes feature branch 
          - switches to develop branch
        
        - **Publish a Feature**
      
        - **Pulling Features**
      
   + Release Branches      
      
   + HotFix Branches
